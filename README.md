# havel-hakimi-algorithm

An implementation of Havel-Hakimi algorithnm made by taking advantage of some already existing functions of networkx library.
This algorithm is widely used for constructing graphs from graphical sequences (part of the ediscrete maths and graph theory).
The user gives as input the number of nodes and the degree of each node and based on that, th eprogram show a graph as the given sequence dictates.
